Pootle under Nginx
==================

Running Pootle under a web server such as Nginx will improve performance. For
more information about Nginx and WSGI, visit `Nginx's WSGI page
<http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxNgxWSGIModule>`_

A Pootle server is made up of static and dynamic content. By default Pootle
serves all content, and for low-latency purposes it is better to get other
webserver to serve the content that does not change, the static content. It is
just the issue of low latency and making the translation experience more
interactive that calls you to proxy through Nginx.  The following steps show you
how to setup Pootle to proxy through Nginx.


.. _nginx#proxy:

Proxying with Nginx
-------------------

The default Pootle server runs at port 8000 and for convenience and simplicity
does ugly things such as serving static files â€” you should definitely avoid that
in production environments.

By proxying Pootle through nginx, the web server will serve all the static media
and the dynamic content will be produced by the app server.

.. code-block:: nginx

   server {
      listen  80;
      server_name  pootle.example.com;

      access_log /path/to/pootle/logs/nginx-access.log;

      charset utf-8;

      location /assets {
          alias /path/to/pootle/env/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pootle/assets/;
          expires 14d;
          access_log off;
      }

      location / {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_redirect     off;

        proxy_set_header   Host             $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }
    }


.. _nginx#proxy_fastcgi:

Proxying with Nginx (FastCGI setup)
-----------------------------------

Run Pootle as a FastCGI application::

    $ python manage.py runfcgi host=127.0.0.1 port=8080

There are more possible parameters available. See::

    $ python manage.py help runfcgi

And add the following lines to your Nginx config file:

.. code-block:: nginx

   server {
      listen  80;  # port and optionally hostname where nginx listens
      server_name  example.com translate.example.com; # names of your site
      # Change the values above to the appropriate values

      location ^~ /assets/ {
          root /path/to/pootle/;
      }

      location / {
          fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8000;
          fastcgi_param QUERY_STRING $query_string;
          fastcgi_param REQUEST_METHOD $request_method;
          fastcgi_param CONTENT_TYPE $content_type;
          fastcgi_param CONTENT_LENGTH $content_length;
          fastcgi_param REQUEST_URI $request_uri;
          fastcgi_param DOCUMENT_URI $document_uri;
          fastcgi_param DOCUMENT_ROOT $document_root;
          fastcgi_param SERVER_PROTOCOL $server_protocol;
          fastcgi_param REMOTE_ADDR $remote_addr;
          fastcgi_param REMOTE_PORT $remote_port;
          fastcgi_param SERVER_ADDR $server_addr;
          fastcgi_param SERVER_PORT $server_port;
          fastcgi_param SERVER_NAME $server_name;
          fastcgi_pass_header Authorization;
          fastcgi_intercept_errors off;
          fastcgi_read_timeout 600;
      }
    }

.. note::

  The ``fastcgi_read_timeout`` line is only relevant if you're getting Gateway
  Timeout errors and you find them annoying. It defines how long (in seconds,
  default is 60) Nginx will wait for response from Pootle before giving up.
  Your optimal value will vary depending on the size of your translation
  project(s) and capabilities of the server.

.. note::

  Not all of these lines may be required. Feel free to remove those you find
  useless from this instruction.
