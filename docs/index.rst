Pootle
======

Pootle is an online tool that makes the process of translating so much simpler.
It allows crowd-sourced translations, easy volunteer contribution and gives
statistics about the ongoing work. You can run Pootle as an Internet server
or run your own copy on an Intranet.

Pootle is built using the powerful API of the `Translate Toolkit` and the
`Django framework`. If you want to know more about these, you can dive into
their own documentation.

The following pages cover the documenation of Pootle from a wide variety of
perspectives, including user's, server administrator's, and developer's view.
