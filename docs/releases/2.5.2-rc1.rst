===================================
Welcome to the new Pootle 2.5.2-rc1
===================================

*Not yet released*

For those who can't wait you might be interested to know what we've got planned
on our :ref:`roadmap <roadmap>`.

Changes in Requirements
=======================
- Django >= 1.5.5 < 1.6
- `Translate Toolkit <http://toolkit.translatehouse.org/download.html>`_ >=
  1.12.0-rc1
- Python >= 2.6

Major Changes
=============

These are by no means exhaustive, check the `git log
<https://github.com/translate/pootle/compare/stable%2F2.5.1...master>`_
for more details.

- Local Translation Memory (TM) that allows to reuse translations done in
  Pootle.
- The ``view`` permission is now project-centric. So you need to assign view
  permissions again!
- Dropped code for several external apps from Pootle codebase. Also upgraded to
  newer versions of those apps.
- Some changes in the API.
- New management command to assign permissions to a user.


...and lots of refactoring, upgrades of upstream code, cleanups to remove
Django 1.4 specifics, improved documentation and of course, loads of bugs were
fixed.
