Welcome to the Pootle 2.6.0 Interim
===================================

*Not yet released*

The 2.6.0 release is an interim release. It is used to migrate from Pootle

Major Changes
=============

- Upgrade:

  - Direct upgrade is now only possible from 2.1.1 and later.
  - Fixed direct upgrade from 2.1.6 and older that required an intermediate
    upgrade to 2.5.0.

- Using dumpdata and loaddata to move between databases is no longer supported.
  If you need to move, please use proper SQL scripts instead.


Removed features
================

We have dropped some legacy upgrade features.  The removal of some of these
feature means that upgrading directly from ancient Pootle versions is no longer
possible.

If you are upgrading from Pootle 2.1.0 or older you must first upgrade to 2.1.6
before upgrading to this version.
