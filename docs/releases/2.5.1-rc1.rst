===================================
Welcome to the new Pootle 2.5.1-rc1
===================================

*Released on ?? November 2013*

We almost missed our 6 month cycle!  Many changes have gone into 2.5.1 which
follows on from 2.5.0 released 6 months ago.

Pootle 2.5.0 has been in production with many users, so although it is a new
official release, we've had many people running their production server off
this code.  This includes `LibreOffice
<https://translations.documentfoundation.org/>`_, `Mozilla
<http://mozilla.locamotion.org/>`_ and `Evernote
<http://translate.evernote.com/pootle/>`_. So you are in good company.

Requirements
============
- Django 1.4
- `Translate Toolkit <http://toolkit.translatehouse.org/download.html>`_ >=
  1.10.0
- lxml (now a runtime requirement)
- Python >= 2.6

Installation and Upgrade
========================

Changes
=======

These are by no means exhaustive, check the git log for more details

Tagging
-------
Tagging of translation projects is now possible.  Tags allow you to classify
translation projects and files to allow you to quickly focus on a number of
languages or a number of files.

Goals
-----
Goals allow you to group files within a project to ensure that translators
focus on the most important tasks first. In single file projects this may not
be important.  But in projects such as Firefox with over 200 files it is
important to direct translators to the most important tasks.

Goals are a special case of tags. You can create goals for an individual
language or you can create project wide goals.  Use the `add_project_goals
<http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/server/commands.html#add-project-goals>`_
command to automatically load a set of project goals.

Action Command Extensions
-------------------------
You can create custom actions using Python scripts.  This allows scripts. e.g.
to build a language pack, to be exposed to the translators.

Other changes
-------------
* Select2 to make dropdowns more user friendly.
* Pootle now uses South to manage smoother migrations to new versions.


...and of course, loads of bugs were fixed
