Changes With Respect To Upstream
================================

Evernote's needs differ from the Pootle-as-a-product perspective, and we
have seen the need to `fork the upstream product
<https://github.com/evernote/pootle/commit/8140ff1706>`_ to adapt it to
our specific needs. This involves adding new features and customizing the
existing product. We have also ripped out unneeded stuff and cleaned up
code to make it easier for us to work with no distractions.
