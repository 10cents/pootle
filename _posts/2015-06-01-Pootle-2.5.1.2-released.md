title: Pootle bugfix release 2.5.1.2
category: releases
---

Yes, we did miss our [6 month release
cycle](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/developers/release.html#principles)
again! We are working hard to get the new Pootle 2.7.0 out, but while it is
being finished we want to provide a newer stable version for the 2.5.1 branch.

Pootle 2.5.1 has now been in production for some time and eventually some bugs
have been reported and fixed. These new changes had been tested on some heavily
used production Pootle servers including [Mozilla](http://mozilla.locamotion.org/)
and [Evernote](http://translate.evernote.com/pootle/). So you are in good
company.

For those who can't wait you might be interested to know what we've got planned
on our
[roadmap](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/developers/roadmap.html)
for Pootle 2.7.0 or even check out the latest available code.
