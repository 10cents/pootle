category: releases
---

This is a release candidate for the next major release for Pootle 2.9.0 We would greatly appreciate any testing and bug reports so we can make sure 2.9.0 final release is as bug-free as possible.

The major changes in this release are:

- Stabler Pootle FS:
  - Pootle FS by default - `update_stores` and `sync_stores` remain for backward compatibility but they will be running using Pootle FS.
  - Improved bi-directional merging of conflicting changes in both database and disk.
- Bugfixes in Pootle FS, serialization, internationalization and the editor.
- Performance boost in permissions forms. 
- Major review of documentation.


The release notes are available in [Pootle documentation](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/releases/2.9.0.html).
