This release is a beta for next major release for Pootle 2.9.0. We would greatly appreciate any testing and bug reports so we can make sure 2.9.0 final release is as bug-free as possible.

The major changes in this release are:

- Better integration of Pootle FS
- All caches are not correctly obsoleted
- Major review of documentation

The release notes are available in [Pootle documentation](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/releases/2.9.0.html).
