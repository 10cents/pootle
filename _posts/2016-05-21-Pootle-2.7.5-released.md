title: Pootle bugfix release 2.7.5
category: releases
---

This is a bugfix release to solve 2.7.4 release install issues. Also we strongly recommended everybody with Pootle 2.7.x to upgrade.

A newer Pootle 2.8.0 is coming soon with lots of performance improvements and a few new features. We will be very grateful if people would help us by beta testing it.

The major changes in this release are:

- Fixed build process to get a working package
- Expanded list or RTL languages

The release notes are available in [Pootle documentation](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/stable-2.7.5/releases/2.7.5.html).
