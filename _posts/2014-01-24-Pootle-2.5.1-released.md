title: Welcome to the new Pootle 2.5.1
category: releases
---
Yes, we did miss our [6 month release
cycle](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/developers/release.html#principles)!
Many changes have gone into Pootle 2.5.1 which follows on from 2.5.0 released
in May.

Pootle 2.5.1 has been in production for a number of users, so although it is a
new official release, we've had many people running their production Pootle
server off this code.  This includes [Mozilla](http://mozilla.locamotion.org/)
and [Evernote](http://translate.evernote.com/pootle/). So you are in good
company.

For those who can't wait you might be interested to know what we've got planned
on our
[roadmap](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/developers/roadmap.html)
for Pootle 2.5.2.

Changes in Requirements
=======================
- Django >= 1.4.10 (note that Django 1.5 and 1.6 are not yet supported)
- [Translate Toolkit](http://toolkit.translatehouse.org/download.html) >=
  1.11.0-rc1
- Python >= 2.6

Installation and Upgrade
========================
- [Installation](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/server/installation.html)
- [Upgrade](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/server/upgrading.html)

Major Changes
=============

These are by no means exhaustive, check the [git
log](https://github.com/translate/pootle/compare/stable%2F2.5.0...2.5.1-rc1)
for more details.

- [Tags](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/features/tags.html) -
  You can now tag and filter translation projects, making it easy to focus on a
  set of languages.
- [Goals](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/features/goals.html) -
  you can now group files within a project to ensure that translators focus on
  the most important tasks first.
- [Extension Actions](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/features/actions.html) -
  you can create custom actions using Python scripts. These are displayed with
  current actions and allow you to extend Pootle's functionality.
- [API](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/api/index.html) -
  an initial Pootle API is in place (disabled by default).


Changes since 2.5.1-rc1
-----------------------
- Goals: more efficient cache flushing mechanism, sites with large projects
  took very long to submit new translations.
- LDAP: explicit import of ldap.filter
- Tags: restrict accepted taggit versions to those that will work with Pootle's
  use of tags.


Important server admin changes
------------------------------
- Pootle now uses South to manage database upgrades.  A single command replaces
  the various command used previously and the automatic update has been
  removed.
- Fabric deployment scripts have been improved to make deployment easier.
- Security fixes identified by a Mozilla security audit have been implemented.
- Optimisations of asset caching such as Expires headers have been enabled.
- Various LDAP fixes.
- Static pages can now be used to track the acceptance of terms of use.


Visual Changes
--------------
- User contribution are displayed in the users profile page.
- Breadcrumbs now follow the way a translator would interact with Pootle and
  are unified across all vies of the project.
- Global search allows you to search across all projects and all languages.
- Last activity messages show quickly what last change was made to the
  translations.
- The export view allows for easier proofreading by translators.
- Various RTL fixes.


...and lots of refactoring, upgrades of upstream code, cleanups to remove
Django 1.3 specifics, missing documentation and of course, loads of bugs were
fixed
