title: Pootle bugfix release 2.7.4
category: releases
---

This is a bugfix release to solve 2.7.3 release install issues. Also we
strongly recommended everybody with Pootle 2.7.x to upgrade.

A newer Pootle 2.8.0 is coming soon with lots of performance improvements and a
few new features. We will be very grateful if people would help us by beta
testing it.

The major changes in this release are:

- Updated some requirements to prevent failures on rebuilding assets
- Requirements now use ranges to prevent installing broken versions

The release notes are available in [Pootle documentation](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/stable-2.7.4/releases/2.7.4.html).
