category: releases
---

This release is a beta for next major release for Pootle 2.9.0. We would greatly appreciate any testing and bug reports so we can make sure 2.9.0 final release is as bug-free as possible.

The major changes in this release are:

- Pootle FS by default - `update_stores` and `sync_stores` remain for backward compatibility but theyâ€™ll be running using Pootle FS.
- Bugfixes for Pootle FS and serialization
- Major review of documentation
- Fixed localization issues


The release notes are available in [Pootle documentation](http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/releases/2.9.0.html).
