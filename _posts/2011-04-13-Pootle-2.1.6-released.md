title: Pootle 2.1.6 released
category: releases

The main focus of the release is incompatibility issues with the latest
versions of Django (1.2.5 and 1.3.0).

Apart from that, version 2.1.6 has a handful of fixes. Here are the highlights:

- Fixed another bug with GNU style projects language detection.
- Added a separate project type for UTF-8 encoded Java properties.
- Fixed a bug that would under rare conditions hide some strings from the
  translate page.
- Fixed a bug that caused some translation project level statistics to be
  miscalculated.
- Fix for Qt TS format based on changes in Translate Toolkit 1.9.0

On the first visit after upgrading the upgrade screen will flash for a short
period while translation statistics are recalculated, if running under
Translate Toolkit version 1.9.0 it might last longer as Qt TS files will be
reparsed to benefit from improvements to the format support.

Django 1.2.5 and 1.3.0 compatibility depends on Translate Toolkit version 1.9.0
or above but all users are encouraged to upgrade their versions of Translate
Toolkit. As always Pootle will benefit from fixes and performance improvements
in the latest versions.
