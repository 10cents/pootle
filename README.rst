Pootle
======

Pootle is an online translation and localization tool.  It tries to lower the
barrier of entry,  but also provides tools to enable teams to work towards
higher quality while welcoming newcomers.


Pootle is a Server
------------------

Pootle is written in Python using the Django framework and therefore can be
installed on any web server that supports serving WSGI applications.

A number of translation projects for a number of languages can be hosted on
Pootle.  It allows a team to manage their files, permissions, projects, and
also allows for translation on-line.  Files can be downloaded for offline
translation and later uploaded again.
