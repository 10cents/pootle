Pootle: a web translation and translation management engine
===========================================================

* Web: <http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/index>

* IRC: #pootle on irc.freenode.org


How it works
------------

Pootle can host a number of translation projects for a number of languages.  It
allows a team to manage their files, permissions, projects, and also allows for
translation on-line.  Files can be downloaded for offline translation and later
uploaded again.

Pootle tries to lower the barrier of entry,  but also provides tools to enable
teams to work towards higher quality while welcoming newcomers.
