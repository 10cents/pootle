Pootle is a full featured web application with many possible methods for
installation. This file gives a few brief instructions to get started, but more
complete documentation exists online at
  http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/installation

Pootle depends on a few Python packages, and can optionally use several others
for an optimal feature set and performance. Although a minimal installation
might be enough for initial experimentation, this might not provide the best
security, features or performance.

Although Pootle can be installed like most Python packages, the easiest way is
to simply run it from the extracted archive. Any of the Python packages that
Pootle depends on (like the Translate Toolkit) can be copied into the directory
containing manage.py and should be detected automatically. Of course they can
also be installed using their setup.py sripts, or easy_install or pip - as you
prefer. Examples below all use the package's own setup.py script.

For the impatient with a working Python 2 installation with pip, this command is
a good start:
   pip install django webassets cssmin django-voting lxml South translate-toolkit python-memcached
   tar xvf Pootle-......tar.gz
   cd Pootle-.......
   ./PootleServer

Security note
-------------
The simple method shown above for running Pootle does not use a web server that
is considered safe for production purposes. The recommended way is to run it
under a web server like apache.


Performance note
----------------
The simple method shown above for running Pootle does not configure it for
optimal performance. For best performance, a proper database server is
recommended rather than the default SQLite database, for example. Some
performance related information might be displayed on the admin page if Pootle
detects anything non-optimal. More information:
